# BurnNote

![BurnNote Logo](burnote/static/img/logo.png)

## Overview
BurnNote is a simple yet secure, self-hosted note-taking web application designed to protect sensitive information. Users can create notes that expire after a single read or reach a set expiration date, ensuring maximum privacy and data security.

## Features
- ✅ **Ephemeral Notes**: Notes are automatically deleted after being read.  
- ⏳ **Expiration Control**: Define how long a note remains accessible.  
- 🔒 **Encryption**: Utilizes AES-GCM encryption to safeguard note content.  
- 🌐 **RESTful API**: Allows programmatic access to create, retrieve, and manage notes.  
- ⚙️ **Easy to Deploy**: Developed with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy for quick setup.  
- 📦 **Marshmallow Integration**: Ensures reliable data serialization and validation.  

## Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python 3**  
- 🌶️ **Flask** (Web framework)  
- 🗄️ **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for database interactions)  
- 🧩 **Marshmallow** (Validation and serialization)  
- 🔐 **AES-GCM** via cryptography library (Encryption)  

## Project Structure
- 📂 **/burnote/models**: Contains database models and encryption logic.  
- 📂 **/burnote/api**: Houses the RESTful API definitions and schema validations.  
- 📂 **/burnote/templates**: Template files for the web interface.  
- 📂 **/burnote/static**: Static resources (CSS, JS, etc.).  
- 📂 **/burnote**: Main Flask app logic and configuration.
